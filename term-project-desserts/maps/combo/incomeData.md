Updates 

Gianna- In terms of updates, I worked on adding dot maps of all the grocery stores in D.C. This will later help in collecting all the grocery stores within each ward. Which will be vixulized soon by a barchart histrogram comparison. Problems did occur however when trying to acess the dat due to it being in a CSV format. So to combat that problem I converted it into a GEOjson file to better vizulaize and develop the map easier.
