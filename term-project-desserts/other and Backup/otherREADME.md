# Readme.md: Status Update

### Provide a status update in the readme.md of your project repo that is no more than 250-500 words and includes the following items. This update should be uploaded to your final project repo (do not submit anything to blackboard):

### images of the current interface (rough prototype is fine, but it should be clear you have been able to load part of your data into a static visualization at least). These do not need to be beautiful, just show the progress you've made in getting to a working interface.

### any modifications to your proposed implementation approach. What libraries have you been using? Has your implementation approach changed significantly? If so, why? milestones and schedule. How is your project tracking against your milestones? Are you on schedule? If not, what's blocking you from making progress?

We decided to focus on average and median household incomes for each ward. The libraries that are used are mapboxgl, turf.js, and d3. The implementation approach has changed due to the data that was altered. We are working to expand this option a bit more. 

Some challenges we have had were with the data and collecting it. We have used two typed of datasets and manually entered the numbers from these sets. The first being grocery store locations, and public school data. The third data set we are using is DC Health Matters which has 2021 Demographics. 

### your code pushed to the repo, with a public-facing link to the interface If you did not receive full credit for your design document, particularly the project realization, this is an opportunity to show that you have responded to that feedback.






What's done:

[ X ] Base map of DC with district outlines

[ X ] Collected & inspected all data needed




Challenges so far:
 
 - had to switch from WCL (late start)
 - had a short window to choose a new project
 
 What we're using:
 - mapBox gljs
 - turf.js
 - d3.js
