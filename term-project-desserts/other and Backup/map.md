# **Files**

- ### map.js
    - has map access token
    - has ready function (will eventually be where we add all other layers)
    - variables that need to be accessed in other files should be declared globally here
- ### datawork.js
    - functions for adding attributes to data go in here (wanted to separate actions where I can to make more readable but ofc open 2 change)
    
- ### sources.js
    - this is where we create map layers & sources
    - also where we add layers to map
